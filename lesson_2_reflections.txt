What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

an empty git repository is created. Needs to be done to allow version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

it is an intermediate area before commiting working files to the repository.
allows you to commit only files where logical breakpoints and changes have been done.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add files corresponding to one logical change to the staging area before commiting.
Can continue to work on the working directory thereafter
just be sure to commit before adding the same file to the staging area.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

1) When you need to make experimentations which you are not sure if they will work
2) When you need to make variations of the same program but will want to retain the previous version. (Eg italian mode; easy mode)
