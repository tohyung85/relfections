Use diff -u game_old.js game_new.js to compare differences in files

Much easier to spot the differences and mistakes. Esp for larger files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Find out if any mistakes were made from one version to the next.
When you need to undo changes it will be great.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros - Versions will be at logical breakpoints
Cons - User driven; can be saved infrequently

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git deals with codes which spans across multiple files. Docs are basically docs right..

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log will show history of commits with IDs
git log --stat will show the number of files changed and number of additions and deltions as well
git diff commitID1 commitID2 will show the changes in the 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If it breaks the problem just go back to previous version!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Version control of my app!

git clone to download repository on computer; default latest will be set
git checkout commitID to download version of repository on comp.
