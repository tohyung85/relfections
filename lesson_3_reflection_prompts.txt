When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Collaborate with others and accessing files across multiple local computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones from one github repository to another. bypasses the need to clone onto the local repository; create a remote and upload onto your own github repository.
Clones are copies of the repository onthe local repository.
branches are commits which are alternative versions of the master branch in the repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The commit will be known as origin/master. I.e the last known state of the remote stored locally. Any changes made by others subsequently will be from this point. So when git fetch is done, a branch of commits made by others to the git hub repository from that point will be created. the other branch will be the local commits made on the local repository.
git merge will then try to merge these 2 once conflicting changes are resolved.
Basically lets you look at and choose which changes should be implemented if there are conflicts.
